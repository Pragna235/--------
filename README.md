# Weather-App-using-REACT

<h3>Project Files</h3> 

<h3>Live Project</h3> - https://pragna235.github.io/REACT_Project_Weather_App/

<h3>Playbook</h3>

* Create your React app in `VSCode` as mentioned in the previous React Project `Login-SignUp-page-using-React`
* Get the Weather API from `openweathermap`
* Integrate it into your `.jsx` file
* Install the `Thunder Client` extension on your VSCode workspace
* Using this extension, we can see the response data coming from the API
* Now go to `openweathermap api` in the browser search bar and get the `api doc` of `Current Weather Data`
* Copy the `url` from the `Examples of API calls` section at the bottom of the page and paste it in the `Thunder Client GET` section
* Get your previously copied `API key` and paste it in the place of `{API Key}` in the `url`.

* To get the temperature in `celsius` instead of kelvin, add `&units=Metric` in the `API request url` after the city name.
* Now use this modified url in your .jsx file for further functioning.
